      <h3>EVconcierge offers custom service and support for electric vehicle buyers and owners</h3>
  		<p>We hope you&apos;ve enjoyed using our rEVolutionary Recommender to find and compare electric vehicles based on the things that matter to you.</p>
  		<p>Our goal is to continue to offer unbiased information and support to buyers who are looking to join the rEVolution. Buying a car is a major investment, and we believe that you should feel 100% confident and comfortable in making the decision to go electric.</p>
  		<p>That&apos;s why the Recommender is just the beginningâ€”over the coming months, we will be unveiling EVconcierge. This new service will provide one-on-one support and assistance to EV buyers and owners. Need help finding a dealer who sells the model you want? Want advice on which home charging setup is best for you? We&apos;ll be here to help.</p>
  		<p>Don&apos;t miss out on the evolution of the rEVolution. <a href="/#/">Sign up for email updates</a> to be notified when EVconcierge and other new site features become available.</p>
